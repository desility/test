    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<p>在我小的时候，人们说，生活艰难是懒惰造成的。长大后，人们又说，生活艰难是时代造成的。再大一点，人们又说生活艰难在于原生家庭。现在，人们又说，生活艰难源自出生寒门。我自己有一段时间，认为生活艰难是由于自己太过善良。<br/>
<span id="more"></span><!-- more --></p>

<p>这些可能都是对的，但由于它们可能都是对的，所以它们几乎必然都是错的。</p>

<p>给命运归因，是一种迷信。我外婆常将她遭遇的不幸，归咎于多年前路过一个寺庙，她没有进去跪拜。没人认为她说的有道理，但很多人会认为命运真的有因。命运没有因，它不是河流，有一个明确的源头。命运是一个综合产物，你在此刻的生活，只是命运的一个片段。</p>

<p>我之前时常幻想，假如自己能够更不要脸一点，也许现在会过得更好一点。这种幻想是有快感的，因为它能遮蔽我的懒惰和不思进取，也能掩盖我的人格缺陷和能力不足，并且一开始就把我抬上道德高地，俯瞰众生。</p>

<p>原生家庭更和谐一点，出身再好一点，长得更帅一点，更美一点，拥有的学历更高一点，也许你会过得更好一点。但也只是也许而已。这些东西都是迷信之人在尘世路过的庙宇，最后，人倒霉时，总会想起其中最大的几个。</p>

<p>一个会计，不做假账。这有很多种原因，未必就是因为他比别人善良。他可能是胆小，可能是有更世俗的梦想，所以不愿为了眼前的蝇头小利葬送前程。就像我，不写丧良心的文章，一方面是因为有良心太久了，一下子真写不出来。另一方面是比起名声和金钱，我更喜欢姑娘，我希望自己能做一个很体面的人，被姑娘喜欢。</p>

<p>世间那些自以为善良的人，也未必真的多善良。真善良的人，不会将命运的因归于善良。真善良的人会在善良中获得快乐和幸福，而生活在幸福和快乐中的人，通常没心思去寻找自身命运的起源。</p>

    <updated>2019-01-31T14:06:31-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.yangcun.ml/15489651912346.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<h2 id="toc_0">一、中国风的定义</h2>

<p>中国风是建立在中国传统文化的基础上，蕴含大量中国元素并适应全球流行趋势的艺术形式或生活方式。</p>

<p>中国风的设计相较于其他设计风格，更符合大家从小耳濡目染的审美趣味。<img src="media/15489651912346/15489652409535.jpg" alt=""/><span id="more"></span><!-- more --></p>

<h2 id="toc_1">二、中国风元素</h2>

<p>国人从小学课本到春节春联年画，不断接受传统文化的熏陶，而中国元素也是从传统文化生活中提炼出来的。</p>

<p><img src="media/15489651912346/15489652856963.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
在设计中，可以通过提取中国传统图形，将其转化为画面中的元素，直观的体现中国设计风格。</p>

<p><img src="media/15489651912346/15489652996945.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
中国风PPT中，我们会经常看到<strong>笔刷素材</strong>的使用，很多图片也是以笔刷素材为原样，填充进去的，都是不规则的图片。<img src="media/15489651912346/15489653122917.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<h2 id="toc_2">三、中国风颜色</h2>

<p>红色和金色是中国最具有代表性的颜色，遇到节庆类型的时候，我们也多会采用此类色彩。</p>

<p><img src="media/15489651912346/15489653339613.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
日常一些的会使用色彩饱和度不高的颜色，如水墨的相关色，一般在进行配色时会以设计主题进行色彩搭配，为画面营造较为统一和谐的氛围。</p>

<p><img src="media/15489651912346/15489653435604.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
以水带墨、色墨碰撞渗化，形成画面一种灵动、氤氲、朦胧、含蓄耐读的水墨画。</p>

<p><img src="media/15489651912346/15489653512267.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<h2 id="toc_3">四、中国风字体</h2>

<p>书法字体天生带有一种传统文化的气息，中国的书法字体是汉字特有的艺术形式，同一个文字用不同手法来写，传递出来的精神和意境是不同的，这使得汉字具有了很高的艺术美学价值。<strong>书法字体</strong>推荐<strong>汉仪尚巍手书</strong>、<strong>禹卫书法行书</strong>等；</p>

<p><strong>衬线字体</strong>，有一种飘逸感，也带有一种中国味，衬线字体推荐<strong>方正清刻本悦简体</strong>、<strong>方正姚体</strong>等<img src="media/15489651912346/15489654197489.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
<img src="media/15489651912346/15489654256100.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
<img src="media/15489651912346/15489654297760.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<ul>
<li> 衬线字体 -</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_4">五、中国风排版</h2>

<p><strong>文字排版：</strong>中国古代的阅读习惯是从上自下，从右自左，所以在中国风的PPT排版上，也大多采用纵向排版。</p>

<p><img src="media/15489651912346/15489654556558.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
<img src="media/15489651912346/15489654595203.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
<strong>留白运用：</strong>中国风常用大面积的留白，以凸显传统、古朴的气质。同时利用留白将视线聚焦在主要想表达的地方。<img src="media/15489651912346/15489654726091.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<h2 id="toc_5">六、中国风意境</h2>

<p>有人或许会问，我在设计的时候都用到了传统元素、传统配色、排版等等都没问题，为什么还是做不出那种中国风的感觉？</p>

<p><img src="media/15489651912346/15489655061770.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
那是因为设计中缺少了意境，从传统画作中可以发现，中国风的画作中经常使用到虚实结合的手法来表达意境，同样设计中也能如此。</p>

<p><img src="media/15489651912346/15489655127451.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<h2 id="toc_6">七、中国风素材</h2>

<p>素材推荐：</p>

<p>觅元素：www.51yuansu.com<br/>
中国色配色网站：<a href="http://zhongguose.com/">http://zhongguose.com/</a></p>

<h2 id="toc_7">笔触改造</h2>

<p>在遇到要用到<strong>书法字体</strong>的时候，考虑到市面上大部分的书法字体大多都是<strong>版权字</strong>，避免踩雷，我们可以尝试通过笔触素材，自己拼字，这有点类似于我们上学时候写毛笔字，一笔一划造出你需要的文字。</p>

<p><img src="media/15489651912346/15489655863369.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
以“秋“为例，下图我把拼接的文字拆分开来，清晰的可以看出文字的笔画。</p>

<p><img src="media/15489651912346/15489655951317.jpg" alt=""/></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<p>非虚构写作，既能保证故事性又保证通过对故事的剪裁输出作者个人的观点和价值取向，并且人人可写，写好了，还可以卖个电影版权，于是成了近几年自媒体的主要内容方向。<span id="more"></span><!-- more --><br/>
非虚构写作介于诚实记录和完全虚构之间，通常需要先对描写对象进行详细调查，之后再对获取到的现实素材做叙事处理，是一个将想象力和现实结合的过程。由于需要对现实做叙事处理，处理姿态就决定了写作姿态。一个罪大恶极的杀人犯，可能会有人性的闪光。一个道德楷模，可能有人格缺陷。这些与描写对象相关的事实证据，作者采纳或不采纳，往往会决定一篇文章的内在逻辑和价值取向。<br/>
非虚构写作具备巨大的传播潜力，毕竟人人都爱看故事，更爱看与现实与自己相关的故事。还能赋予写作者裁剪现实的权力。传播潜力加对现实的裁剪，会使一篇非虚构写作拥有扭曲现实的能力。一篇特稿，可以毁掉一个人，也可以神化一个人。一篇非虚构写作，可以让一个穷凶极恶的杀人犯显得不那么凶残，也可以使一个犯下小错的小偷显得罪大恶极。而且非虚构这三个字，看起来无限接近现实，这也增大了非虚构写作的代入感，或者说，迷惑性。</p>

<blockquote>
<p>一个完全符合人对故事认知的新闻，是假的。一段完全超出旁人想象的经历，恰恰是真的。<br/>
当时我是年轻人，觉得能洁身自好，不去害别人就可以了。现在我是中年人——一个社会里，中年人要负很重的责任：要对社会负责，要对年轻人负责，不能只顾自己。因为这个原故，我开始写杂文。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>假设有一个领域，谦虚的人、明理的人以为它太困难、太暧昧，不肯说话，那么开口说话的就必然是浅薄之徒、狂妄之辈。这导致一种负筛选：越是傻子越敢叫唤。</p>

<p>我认识很多明理的人，但他们都在沉默中，因为他们都珍视自己的清白。但我以为，伦理问题太过重要，已经不容我顾及自身的清白。</p>

<p>别人我不知道，反正我是这样想的。</p>

<p>在信息爆炸的今天，清晰易辨的品牌 logo 更有利于消费者记忆。但无衬线字体的「跟风」也同时引起争议，称它们抹去了百年品牌背后的经典、复杂和优雅个性，变得平淡无趣，「没有灵魂」。</p>

<p>跟 Zara 一起走入 Didot 字体阵营的还有 Dior。</p>

    <link href="http://www.yangcun.ml/15489085035149.html"/>
    <updated>2019-01-30T22:21:43-06:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<p>iText 是一款从图片中识别文字的 OCR 工具。</p>

<p>典型使用场景：</p>

<p>从扫描版 PDF 中提取文字<br/>
从朋友发来的图片中识别文字<br/>
从任意图片中识字<br/>
<span id="more"></span><!-- more --></p>

<h2 id="toc_0">1. 选取图片方便</h2>

<p>iText 支持多种方式选择图片，操作非常便利。</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">1.1 截图即识字</h3>

<p>iText 自带截图功能，只需按下<code>⇧⌘1</code>快捷键、截取屏幕任意位置，即可提取该图片中的文字。<img src="media/15489085035149/006tKfTcgy1flx120m504g30la09qkin.gif" alt="006tKfTcgy1flx120m504g30la09qkin"/></p>

<p>小提示：识别后的文字已经复制到系统剪贴板，直接粘贴即可。</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">1.2 拖拽图片至菜单栏图标识字</h3>

<p>比如，当你在电脑上使用微信、QQ 时，好友发了张图片（比如手机拍摄的快递单），你想识别其中的文字（比如快递单号），只需将该图片拖拽至 iText 菜单栏图标即可。<br/>
<img src="media/15489085035149/006tKfTcgy1flx11nta4zg30hk0bskdz.gif" alt="006tKfTcgy1flx11nta4zg30hk0bskdz"/></p>

<h3 id="toc_3">1.3 选择图片文件识字</h3>

<p>当然，也可以在对话框中选择图片文件。不过，个人还是建议你直接把该图片文件拖拽至 iText 菜单栏图标，操作直观高效。</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">1.4 支持连续识别</h3>

<p>比如，连续截取 PDF 不同位置的图片，iText 将依次识别其中的文本，并自动将结果拼接在一起。<br/>
<img src="media/15489085035149/mvrl6.png" alt="mvr"/></p>

<h2 id="toc_5">2. 文字识别精准</h2>

<p><strong>你有没有这种经历：</strong>你想从一张图片中提取文字，结果发现识别的文字中有一些错误。结果，手动修改这些错误的时间，比自己直接在电脑上码字的时间还要长。是不是很尴尬？</p>

<p>可见，<strong>识别的准确性非常重要</strong>，也是我非常在意的一点。</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">2.1 腾讯、百度、Google 三引擎</h3>

<p><strong>首先，我排除了离线的识别库，</strong>因为离线注定了这些库的识别能力是死的，不会自己增强。接下来，在一票在线 OCR 服务中，我对比了百度、腾讯、微软、Google 这些四家大厂的产品，最后选择了**国内使用腾讯及百度、国外使用 Google **的组合。</p>

<p><img src="media/15489085035149/15489086794460.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>如果你有 Google 信仰、或者需要识别日文等其他语言，可以右击 iText 菜单栏图标，手动选择使用腾讯、百度或 Google OCR 服务。不过，从实测和目前优化的情况来看，中文还是建议使用腾讯；大家可以自行测试。</p>

<p>那么，到底识别准不准呢？这么说吧：</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>对于一般的自然语言</strong>，比如书中的一段话、新闻稿，<strong>识别效果是惊人的准确，甚至可以达到 100%</strong></li>
<li><strong>对于排版复杂、尤其有特殊字符的文字</strong>，比如程序代码、选择题，识别效果就不太理想，<strong>需要手动对识别后的结果进行修正</strong>
<ul>
<li>比如，单纯地给一个竖线，机器是无法区分到底是小写的 l、还是大写的 I（顺便问一下，你看出二者的区别了吗？）；与之相对，<strong>机器是需要根据上下文进行判断和优化的</strong>。而像程序代码这种非自然语言，机器目前是很难进行语义识别的</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>到底准不准？欢迎你来试试。</p>

<h3 id="toc_7">2.2 独创算法，进一步优化识别结果</h3>

<p>OCR 服务完成最好的是字符的识别；但更进一步的识别，目前还不是很好，比如段落的识别、全角半角符号等等，这就需要程序后期进行优化。</p>

<p>目前，iText 主要完成了这些部分的优化：</p>

<ul>
<li>自动识别段落</li>
<li>中文环境使用全角标点符号</li>
<li>中文与英文字母、数字间增加空格</li>
<li>删除中文字符间、英文字符与标点符号间的多余空格</li>
<li>英文首字母大写</li>
</ul>

<p>如果你发现优化的不好的地方，欢迎把图发给我，我会相应地优化算法，先谢。</p>

<p><strong>2.3 预览原图，方便校对</strong><br/>
在目前 OCR 技术不能始终达到 100% 的情况下，预览原图、并进行修正，还是有必要的。在 iText 中，你可以这样：</p>

<ul>
<li>将识别后的窗口拖到图片附近</li>
<li>调用 iText 识别结果的 双栏模式：左侧展示图片、右侧展示识别后的文字
<ul>
<li>可使用快捷键<code>⇧⌘R</code>快速调出识别结果窗</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/15489085035149/15489088622531.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>这样，就可以很方便地对照原图进行手动优化识别后的文字。</p>

<h3 id="toc_8">2.4 自动隐藏识别结果</h3>

<p>由于 iText 的识别结果已经非常准确，且已经复制到剪贴板，因此识别后并不需要编辑或复制文本。此时，你可以如上图所示，开启「自动隐藏」选项，识别结果窗口将会在 3s 后自动隐藏，非常方便。</p>

<p>并且，如果临时需要编辑某次识别结果，只要将鼠标移至结果窗口，则会暂时忽略自动隐藏功能。另外，开启「总在最前」选项后，窗口将不会自动隐藏。</p>

<h2 id="toc_9">3. 识别后自动翻译</h2>

<p>比如，对于英文版的 PDF、未翻译的字幕、未汉化的游戏，直接用 iText 截图，自动翻译为中文。<br/>
<img src="media/15489085035149/006tNc79gy1fmytn28rkwg30iw0ayb29.gif" alt="006tNc79gy1fmytn28rkwg30iw0ayb29"/></p>

<p>集成 Google、百度双引擎（优先选用 Google，当无法访问 Google 时使用百度），支持 100+ 种语言。</p>

<h2 id="toc_10">4. 下载与付费</h2>

<p>每月可免费识别 20 次，充分体验产品功能；订阅 iText 高级版即可无限次识别。</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/id1314980676?ls=1&amp;mt=12&amp;at=1000lv4R&amp;ct=iText_me"><img src="media/15489085035149/15489089134473.jpg" alt=""/></a></p>

<p><a href="http://t.cn/EtYAe73">网盘下载 </a><br/>
<code>先安装低版本，再用高版本覆盖，不要升级</code></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<p>Cameras come in many forms and many types, but no matter whether the camera is costly or inexpensive, uses film or digital sensors, has one lens or can use many lenses, all cameras have the same basic characteristics.<br/>
<img src="media/15125648977119/15126530968777.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
<span id="more"></span><!-- more --></p>

<h2 id="toc_0">2.1 Anatomy of a Camera</h2>

<p><strong>THE BASICS</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ol>
<li>A light-tight box</li>
<li>A lens</li>
<li>A shutter to regulate time of exposure</li>
<li>An aperture to regulate volume of light</li>
<li>A place to put light-sensitive material</li>
<li>A viewfinder to see what the camera will make a photograph of.</li>
</ol>

<p>A camera is actually a very simple device. Or, at least, it can be. To make a camera, all that’s really required is a light-tight box, a lens that can focus light rays through one side of the box, something to regulate the volume of light that comes into the box (a variable <strong>aperture</strong>), something to regulate how long the light is allowed to come into the box (a <strong>shutter</strong>) and something to record what the projected light is showing. That’s it; it’s really pretty simple.</p>

<p>In fact, it can be even more simple; a small hole in the side of a light-tight box will project an image of whatever is outside the box onto the inside of the box. The hole is the aperture; all you need is a shutter to regulate the time of light and something to record the image and you have a camera.</p>

<p>Of course, modern cameras have made a simple machine more complex by adding a wide variety of features to control the camera’s functions. But, no matter how sophisticated the camera is, no matter how much it costs and no matter what style or type of camera it is, every camera in the world has the same basic simple characteristics. Use the interactive graphics on the next two pages to help familiarize yourself with the parts of a DSLR camera’s inner and outer workings.</p>

<p><img src="media/15125648977119/15125651985670.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>Use the interactive graphic below to help familiarize yourself with the inside elements of a typical DSLR camera.</p>

A Digital Single-Lens Reflex Camera – The Outside View</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">2.2 Types of Cameras</h2>

<p><strong>THE BASICS</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ol>
<li>Point-and-shoot</li>
<li>Mirrorless</li>
<li>Single-lens reflex</li>
<li>Medium format</li>
<li>Large Format</li>
<li>Camera Phones</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="media/15125648977119/15125655891208.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
We can crop a section out of the image, but we would have to accept a smaller image to print, as there aren’t enough pixels to make a very large image.</p>

<p>All cameras are more or less the same; they need the elements you just read about in the previous section. No matter how much the camera costs or what its features are, it has the same basic elements of light-tight box, lens, shutter, aperture, etc.</p>

<p>So, if every camera is the same, then why are there different types of cameras? The answer is similar to why there are different types of cars; there are different things we want cameras to do, and their design changes to accommodate different needs. Small cameras are great for their portability and their ability to be unobtrusive. Larger cameras are typically able to record greater detail because of their larger sensors or because of their higher quality lenses… or both.</p>

<p>As technologies have evolved, different camera types and styles have been created to take advantage of new ways of making photographs so photographers can have the right tool for the job. Tap the presentation at right to see a few of the different types of cameras that photographers use.</p>

<p>Pixels are the building blocks of the digital image world. They are they tiny picture elements (hence &quot;<strong>pixel</strong>&quot;) that make up the image. The more of them you have, the greater the potential you have for detail in a picture. Think of a mosaic picture; the more tiles there are in the picture, the more detail it can contain.</p>

<p>Camera pixel sensors come in an x-y grid that record the amount and color of the light in a scene. We can count the number of pixels horizontally and vertically on that grid and come up with the total number of pixels a camera has by multiplying one number by the other. So, a camera that has 3072 pixels by 2304 pixels would have 7,077,888 total pixels, or, rounding up, 7.1 <strong>megapixels</strong>. Mega means &quot;million&quot; and the term megapixel has become the standard that is used to measure the relative resolution of cameras. The greater the number of pixels a camera has the more its images can be enlarged before pixels can be seen.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind when thinking about pixel count is the concept of &quot;<strong>cropping</strong>&quot; a photograph. When a photograph is cropped to improve its composition or to zero in on the image information that&#39;s most important to the viewer, parts of the image are removed. When you crop your digital photographs, you are removing pixels, so the total pixel count of your image goes down, reducing its resolution and therefore the size to which it can be enlarged.</p>

<p>Photography is all about light.</p>

<p>Controlling how much light gets into the camera and how it gets there is one of the most important parts of learning photography.</p>

<p>Getting the correct exposure for a given scene is important for the highest quality photographs, but that’s only part of the story, as exposure is also a creative tool, allowing you to make your pictures look the way you want them to.<br/>

<h2 id="toc_0">3.1   Aperture</h2>

<p>**THE BASICS **</p>

<hr/>

<ol>
<li>The aperture controls the volume of light that enters the camera by adjusting the<br/>
size of a hole in the camera’s lens</li>
<li>A large hole lets in lots of light and is defined by a small number (ex: ƒ/4)</li>
<li>A small hole lets in a small amount of light and is defined by a large number (ex: ƒ/16)</li>
<li>The smaller the aperture’s hole, the more things are in focus near-to-far in a scene; when the aperture hole is large, fewer things are in focus near-to-far</li>
<li>The aperture value is either set by the camera in one of the automatic shooting modes, or set by the photographer in manual mode</li>
</ol>

<p>Like the iris in your eye, your camera’s aperture is a hole in the lens that changes size, regulating the volume of light that enters the camera. As the aperture opens to a larger hole, it lets more light into the camera. Conversely, a smaller hole  will let less light into the camera. Though the term aperture is most often used, you will sometimes see apertures referred to as f-stops, often with an italicized “ƒ” and a slash, as in ƒ/8. The terms aperture and ƒ-stop are interchangeable.</p>

<p>In addition to its function of controlling the volume of light that enters the camera, the aperture can also alter the amount of things that are in focus in your photographs. A smaller aperture hole will have more things in focus near-to-far in a scene, while a larger aperture hole will allow you to focus on one spot in your scene and blur things that are closer to or farther from the camera. This is called <strong>depth of field</strong> or sometimes depth of focus. So, the aperture is both a technical and a creative control.</p>

<p>In order to predict and repeat a certain volume of light entering the camera, a particular aperture’s “hole size” is expressed by a number. So, a very small aperture hole is ƒ/22, a large hole is ƒ/4. These numbers can be a bit confusing at first because they seem contrary. If you can just remember that a small aperture hole is expressed by a big number and a large aperture hole is expressed by a small number, you’ll be fine.</p>

<p>The largest aperture (remember, smaller number) available on a lens varies depending on the type of lens, the lens design and the cost of the lens, but most lenses start with aperture numbers around ƒ/2.8, ƒ/3.5 or ƒ/4. The bigger the maximum aperture on a lens, the “faster” that lens is said to be, as it lets more light into the camera. The smallest aperture (remember, bigger number) on a given lens also varies, but most lenses have ƒ/16 or ƒ/22 as their smallest aperture.</p>

<p>Apertures have a standard set of numbers that are “whole” apertures or “whole stops.” Moving from one aperture setting to the next whole aperture setting either doubles the exposure by letting twice as much light into the camera or cuts the exposure in half by letting in half as much light in. Photographers refer to this as changing the exposure by a “<strong>stop</strong>.” The traditional sequence of aperture settings starts at the largest aperture available and progresses like this:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>ƒ/4</th>
<th>ƒ/5.6</th>
<th>ƒ/8</th>
<th>ƒ/11</th>
<th>ƒ/16</th>
<th>ƒ/22</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>So, going from ƒ/4 to ƒ/5.6 is thought of as “one stop less” exposure (because the volume of light gets cut in half). Going from ƒ/16 to ƒ/8 is “two stops more” exposure (because the volume of light has been doubled by two whole apertures.</p>

<p>With the digital controls on modern cameras, you have the ability to change by smaller increments of volume, cutting those “twice” and “half” pieces into “one-third less” and “one-third more.” This is great, because it gives you finer control over the volume of light that is let into your camera. So, your camera can set aperture settings in a 1/3-stop sequence like:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>ƒ/5.6</th>
<th>ƒ/6.3</th>
<th>ƒ/7.1</th>
<th>ƒ/8</th>
<th>ƒ/9</th>
<th>ƒ/10</th>
<th>ƒ/11</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Aside from its function of letting a prescribed volume of light into the camera, aperture can also dramatically alter the way focus occurs in images. The smaller the aperture (like ƒ16 or ƒ/22), the more things are in focus near-to-far in your photographs. The larger the aperture, (like ƒ/2.8 or ƒ/4) the fewer things are in focus near-to-far in your photographs.</p>

<p><strong>Apertures</strong><br/>
<img src="media/15125658799576/15125667041456.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>Standard Whole Apertures</p>

<p><strong>Setting The Aperture</strong></p>

<p>Setting the aperture on your camera is accomplished diﬀerently, depending on what exposure mode you have set on your camera:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Aperture Priority Mode</strong> allows you to set
the aperture you want and the camera sets the shutter speed for you.</li>
<li><strong>Manual Mode</strong> will allow you to set the
aperture you want and then you will have to manually set the correct shutter speed for that lighting condition.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the <strong>Exposure Modes</strong> section  for more information.</p>

<p>Here, an aperture of ƒ/16 provides lots of depth of field, so both the horizon and nearby objects are in focus.</p>

<p><img src="media/15125658799576/15125668412029.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<h2 id="toc_1">3.2   Shutter Speed</h2>

<p><strong>THE BASICS</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ol>
<li>The shutter controls the length of time that<br/>
light has to enter the camera</li>
<li>Shutter speeds are expressed in fractions<br/>
of seconds (ex: 1/250 of a second, usually<br/>
just 1/250 or even just “250”)</li>
<li>A long shutter speed lets in lots of light and<br/>
is defined by a large number (ex: 1/2 or 1/8)</li>
<li>A short shutter speed lets in a small<br/>
amount of light and is defined by a small<br/>
number (ex: 1/500 or 1/1000)</li>
<li>The shorter the shutter speed, the more the<br/>
camera can stop motion in the frame; the<br/>
longer the shutter speed, the more motion<br/>
in the frame will be blurred</li>
<li>The shutter speed is either set by the<br/>
camera in one of the automatic shooting<br/>
modes, or set by the photographer in<br/>
manual mode</li>
</ol>

<p>Whether the goal is stopping fast action or creating a blur, the shutter is the setting that allows you to control the length of time light enters the camera. The shutter is actually one of the most creative controls that there is in photography, allowing you to express the element of time in your images. Sometimes, you’ll want to stop the action of a quickly moving subject with a fast shutter speed. Other times, you’ll want to blur the subject’s motion with a slow shutter speed.</p>

<p>For most of your photographs, you will use shutter speeds that are fractions of a second, like 1/125 of a second. Because of that, shutter speed settings on the camera can be a bit confusing at first because many camera settings leave oﬀ the top part of the fraction that they are expressing, so a small number (1/250) looks like a big one (250). The key is to remember that the numbers are fractions so “500” is actually a shorter amount of time than “250”.</p>

<p>Action in your scene can be stopped by using a fast shutter speed like 1/250, 1/500 or 1/1000 of a second. Conversely, if you want to blur the motion in a scene, you can use a slow shutter speed like 1/30, 1/15 or 1/8 of a second.</p>

<p>Not long ago in photography, most cameras had a prescribed set of shutter speeds that were the same on nearly every camera. Moving from one shutter speed to the speed next to it on the camera either doubled the exposure or cut it in half by letting the shutter stay open for either twice as much or half as much time. The traditional sequence of shutter speeds started at 1 second, then moved to 1/2 a second, 1/4, 1/8, 1/15, 1/30, 1/60, 1/125, 1/250, 1/500 and 1/1000 of a second. Note that there are a couple of “fudge factors” where the numbers aren’t exactly half or double to make the numbers more even as the sequence progresses.</p>

<p>Just like with aperture, photographers refer to changing the exposure by doubling or cutting it in half as changing the exposure by a “stop.” So, going from 1/15 of a second to 1/30 of a second is thought of as “one stop less” exposure (because the shutter speed gets cut in half). Going from 1/250 of a second to 1/60 of a second is “two stops more” exposure because the shutter has been slowed by two whole shutter speeds.</p>

<p>Now, with electronic controls on our cameras, most cameras have the ability to change by smaller increments of time, cutting those “twice” and “half” pieces into “one-third less” and “one- third more.” This is great, because it gives you finer-grained control over how motion is stopped or blurred in your photographs.</p>

<p><img src="media/15125658799576/15125675268067.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>When using slower shutter speeds, you may need to have the camera on a tripod or some other steady support so the camera is stationary and the subject’s movement can be recorded. A rule of thumb is that most people can hand-hold a camera without a tripod and without creating camera shake at shutter speeds that are 1/60 of a second and shorter. This changes as you change the focal length on your camera’s lens as <strong>telephoto</strong> or “long” lenses will tend to magnify camera shake and <strong>wide-angle</strong> or “short” lenses will tend to minimize it.</p>

<p>To minimize camera shake, practice maintaining a steady stance while making photographs and using a gentle squeeze on the shutter release button rather than stabbing it. As you’re photographing, you may also want to look around you for places that you can lean against, sit on or prop your camera on to help keep you and your camera steady.</p>

<p><img src="media/15125658799576/15125674863224.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p><strong>Setting The Shutter Speed</strong></p>

<p>Setting the shutter’s speed is accomplished diﬀerently, depending on what exposure mode you have set on your camera:<br/>
•<strong>Shutter Priority Mode</strong> allows you to set<br/>
the shutter speed you want and the camera sets the aperture for you.<br/>
•<strong>Manual Mode</strong> will allow you to set the<br/>
shutter speed you want and then you will have to manually set the correct aperture for that lighting condition.</p>

<p>See the <strong>Exposure Modes</strong> section for more information.<br/>

<p><em>Here, a shutter speed of 1/1000 of a second froze the motion of the water</em></p>

<p><strong>Panning</strong><br/>
**Panning **is a technique that can be used when photographing fast- moving objects.</p>

<p>A slow shutter speed is used and the camera is moved in the direction of the subject’s movement, keeping the subject in roughly the same position in the frame. This keeps the subject somewhat stationary and gives a motion blur to the background.<br/>

<p>Here, the exposure was ƒ/22 at 1/8 of a second.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">3.3   ISO:   Sensitivity to  Light</h2>

<p>** THE BASICS**</p>

<hr/>

<ol>
<li> Film cameras can only change ISO values by changing the film in the camera; digital cameras can change the ISO at any time with a camera setting</li>
<li> A digital camera’s ISO changes via electronics; an amplifier turns up the “volume” of light sensitivity for high ISO and turns it down for low ISO</li>
<li> The higher the ISO number, the more sensitive to light the camera will be; the lower the ISO number, the lower the camera’s light sensitivity will be</li>
<li> Lower ISO numbers generally will result in sharper, better-quality photographs; higher ISO numbers generally result in photographs that have increased grain or noise</li>
<li> As ISO values change, they change by whole or third “stops”</li>
</ol>

<p>The aperture and shutter speed of your camera control the amount of light that enters the camera, but there is another control that is equally important and that’s the sensitivity of the camera’s digital sensor to the light that falls on it. Like the numbers that are used to describe aperture and shutter speed, camera sensitivity settings are standardized internationally by the International Standards Organization (ISO). So, photographers refer to a camera’s sensitivity to light by talking about its ISO setting.</p>

<p>High ISO numbers (like 3200, 6400, etc) mean that the camera can make photographs in very low light levels because the sensor’s amplifier is turned up high, making it very sensitive to light. Lower ISO numbers (like 200, 400 or even 800) are better choices for making photographs in normal lighting levels.</p>

<p>Film cameras are limited with regard to ISO settings. That’s because the only way a film camera can change its ISO setting is to change the film that’s in the camera. Digital cameras, on the other hand can change their ISO setting by the press of a button. In fact, digital cameras are able to have very high ISO settings; far beyond the capabilities of film, allowing photography in very low light levels.</p>

<p>There is a tradeoff, however. The higher the ISO setting, the more likely the camera’s sensor will generate <strong>digital noise</strong> during the exposure. This is because setting a higher ISO setting on a digital camera simply turns up an amplifier for the light signal. The more the amplification, the more noise is generated. Noise usually shows up in the darker areas of a photograph more than it does in the lighter areas, but with high-ISO images, the grainy look of noise is everywhere.</p>

<p>Most digital cameras have an option for using automatic ISO. This sets the ISO sensitivity for you, depending on the amount of light in the scene. While this can be useful for shooting on the fly when lighting conditions are changing dramatically, it’s probably not the best choice for the highest quality photography. Making sure you know what ISO your camera has set is your best bet for having the best, most noise-free images.</p>

<p>Just like aperture and shutter speed numbers that have a 1:2 relationship (twice as much light, half as much light), ISO settings also represent one-half or two-times the amount of sensitivity. So, 400 ISO is exactly one “stop” more sensitive to light than is ISO 200.    Also just like aperture and shutter speeds, you may see ISO numbers that aren’t “half” and “twice” on your camera. Depending on how you have your camera’s menu system set, you may find that your ISO numbers appear in one-third-stop increments. For practical purposes, a whole-stop (twice as much, half as much) setting is adequate and you should be able to change your camera to whole-stop ISO jumps. Look at this set of images below to see the eﬀects of ISO settings.</p>

<p><img src="media/15125658799576/15125679682934.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
This photograph was made in fairly low light levels with the camera on a tripod</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">3.4   Exposure:  How Much    Light?</h2>

<p><strong>THE BASICS</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ol>
<li> Exposure is controlled by Aperture, Shutter Speed and ISO setting</li>
<li> Each exposure control has a relationship of 1:2 or one “stop” of diﬀerence</li>
<li> An in-camera light meter reads light in scene and helps set the aperture, shutter speed and (sometimes) the ISO</li>
<li> The meter bases its exposure suggestions on an “average” amount of light reflecting from objects in the scene</li>
<li> This “average” light is based on a middle gray reflectance</li>
<li> There is a “correct” exposure (total amount of light) for every scene, but the combination of aperture, shutter and ISO can be different</li>
</ol>

<p>Have you ever noticed that when you leave a movie theater and go out into the bright daylight that after the initial shock of the change in illumination, you get used to the tremendous difference in the amount of light? This is because the human eye and brain have a great exposure mechanism built in and most people can see well in both low light levels and on the brightest of days.</p>

<p>The camera, though, isn’t as instantly flexible as our eyes and brain are and photographers need to control the amount of light that enters the camera in order to get a correct rendition of the scene. Now that you have an understanding of the three basic controls for photographic exposure of aperture, shutter speed and ISO, let’s put them together and see how they interact in what we can refer to as the <strong>Exposure Triangle.</strong></p>

<p>For any given scene, there is an ideal exposure; an ideal for the total amount of light entering the camera. But, since you know that exposure is controlled by several variables, there can be a number of diﬀerent combinations of aperture, shutter speed and ISO to create that given amount of light that should enter the camera.</p>

<p>One of the keys to that interaction is that relationship of 1:2 or “twice as much, half as much” that governs each of these controls. Remembering that moving one whole shutter speed, one whole aperture or one whole ISO number either doubles the amount of light or cuts it in half is an important part of understanding total camera exposure.</p>

<p>The exposure for a given scene is calculated by a <strong>light meter</strong>. Nearly every camera that’s made has an light meter, which is designed to measure the amount of light reflecting oﬀ of the objects in the scene. Once it reads the amount of reflected light, it works with the camera’s settings – and often your input – to determine the correct aperture, shutter speed and ISO combination for a correct exposure.</p>

<p>The light meter is designed to look at the elements of the scene and average the reflectance of everything in the frame, with the idea that most scenes have some very bright things, some very dark things and many things that are of “middle” reflectance. In fact, the light meter makes an assumption that whatever it sees should average out to a middle gray value. In technical photographic terms, this is 18% gray. In most instances, this averaging works quite well, as the majority of scenes in the world have mostly middle reflectance, so the light meter gives an accurate suggestion of a combination of aperture, shutter speed and ISO.</p>

<p>Once you have the meter’s reading of the scene’s reflected light, you can choose the shutter speed, the aperture and the ISO. In practical terms, you are likely to set an ISO first, because you want to control the amount of noise in your images. If you are in normal bright lighting conditions, you will likely choose an ISO of 200, 400 or 800. Then, you can choose the aperture that will give you the depth of field that you want and the shutter speed that stops or blurs motion the way you want.</p>

<p>Remember, though, that since aperture and shutter speeds are interdependent, you may not be able to choose both a small aperture and a fast shutter speed, as this may not produce the required total volume of light entering the camera.  So, how do you know which combination of aperture and shutter speed? This is where the creative elements of photography start to come into play, giving you control over the final result of your photographs.</p>

<p><img src="media/15125658799576/15125682666569.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<h2 id="toc_4">3.5  Camera  Exposure    Modes</h2>

<p><strong>THE BASICS</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ol>
<li>Exposure modes control how the light<br/>
meter’s readings are interpreted by the<br/>
camera</li>
<li>Different modes prioritize different parts of<br/>
the Exposure Triangle</li>
<li>Some exposure modes automate the<br/>
camera’s settings</li>
<li>Other exposure modes give the<br/>
photographer control over the camera’s<br/>
settings</li>
</ol>

<p>In most cameras, determining and setting the correct exposure depends on the exposure mode that you have set on the camera. Nearly all cameras can be controlled by diﬀerent exposure modes, or ways of letting you control the camera’s settings. These modes primarily diﬀer in the way they prioritize the three elements of the exposure triangle.</p>

<p>Most cameras have several exposure modes. <strong>Automatic mode</strong> and <strong>Program mode</strong> apply large amounts of automation to the exposure for your photograph, giving you limited or no control over what settings the camera uses. <strong>Aperture Priority</strong> and <strong>Shutter Priority</strong> modes allow for partially automatic control over the camera’s settings; you set one part of the exposure triangle and the camera sets the other. Manual mode gives you complete manual control over your<br/>
exposure; you set everything on the camera.</p>

<p>Which mode you select depends on what you’re most interested in capturing in your photograph. Your camera’s manual can help you learn which modes you have and how they can be set on your camera.</p>

<p><img src="media/15125658799576/15125684828461.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
<em>Aperture Priority was selected for this image so that ƒ/22 could be set to allow for maximum depth of field. The camera chose the shutter speed.</em></p>

<p>Use this interactive graphic to explore the exposure modes common to most cameras. The generic graphic you see here will likely diﬀer from what you find on your camera, but your camera will be similar. Every mode has its purpose and no one mode is “better” or “worse” than any other.</p>

<p><img src="media/15125658799576/15125685597034.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
Camera Exposure Modes</p>

<p>As long as the reflectance of subjects in the scene is average all of the exposure modes work very well to deliver accurate exposure for your photographs. But what happens when there is something in the scene that is much brighter or much darker than the rest of the objects in the frame? The exposure system can get confused because it doesn’t know that the bright thing is anything other than very light and it will create an exposure that is too dark for what you envision. You need to adjust the exposure so that the photograph you make isn’t too light or too dark.</p>

<p>This is where <strong>Exposure Compensation</strong> comes in. Exposure compensation is a tool found on all contemporary cameras and it allows you to override the settings that any of the program modes set. Most cameras have a dial or a set of buttons that allow you to adjust your exposure up to 2 stops (sometimes more) in 1/3-stop increments up or down the exposure scale to give you the exposure you want. In most cameras, you can see the exposure compensation setting in the camera’s viewfinder.</p>

<p><img src="media/15125658799576/15125686258996.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p><img src="media/15125658799576/15125686327532.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
<em>Because there was so much white tone in the scene, exposure compensation was used. In order to get the white building to show as white, the exposure compensation dial was adjusted to “+1” or one stop more exposure.</em></p>

<p>It’s likely that your camera came with a zoom lens. Often called a “kit” lens, it’s a great starter lens, allowing you to do a variety of things with a fairly wide variety of subjects.</p>

<p>There are, however, other lenses out there for your camera that can expand your range of things that you can do. Other zooms and single-focal-length lenses (often called “prime” lenses) are tools that you may want to add to your photographic arsenal as you progress towards mastery of the medium.<br/>

<h1 id="toc_0">4.1 Lens  Focal   Length</h1>

<p><strong>THE BASICS</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ol>
<li> Focal length is expressed in millimeters; i.e. a 50mm lens</li>
<li> Focal length determines how wide or narrow your field of view is</li>
<li> Telephoto or “long” lenses have a narrow field of view and magnify the subject</li>
<li> Wide angle or “short” lenses have a wide field of view and make the subject appear smaller</li>
<li> Most cameras come with a “kit” lens that is a zoom lens; allowing many focal lengths in one lens</li>
<li> The other basic type of lens is a “prime” lens; it’s focal length is fixed at one field of view</li>
</ol>

<p>The ability to change the focal length of the lens is one of the most wonderfully creative and interesting aspects of photography. Lens focal lengths are usually referred to in millimeters (mm) and don’t refer to the actual physical length of the lens, but rather to the distance that the lens needs to focus inside the camera from the point where the light rays converge to the digital sensor or film at the back of the camera.</p>

<p>The focal length of a lens is an indication of how wide or narrow your camera’s field of view is or how much you see in the scene in front of you. It also indicates the magnification of the scene or how large or how small individual objects in your photograph will be. So, by changing the focal length of the camera’s lens, you can change how much of a scene you see in the frame, allowing you to concentrate the viewer’s attention on more of the overall scene with a wide lens or a small section of your selected subject with a long or telephoto lens.</p>

<p>In addition to changing the field of view, changing your lens focal length can also help you control how your subject in the final photograph. With a wide angle lens, you can exaggerate the diﬀerence in distance between nearby subjects and ones that are farther away. This is due to the fact that wide angle lenses, with their wide field of view, make everything in the frame look smaller. Because they are smaller, you are likely to move closer to your subject, altering the proportion of distance between the nearest objects and the farthest ones.</p>

<p>Conversely, a long or telephoto lens can give the illusion of compressing the space in the camera’s field of view. This is due to the fact that telephoto lenses, with their narrow field of view, make everything in the frame look bigger. Because the subject is bigger, you are likely to move farther from your subject, again altering the proportion of distance between the nearest objects and the farthest ones, but in this case, making those objects appear to be closer in size to each other.</p>

<p>The Importance of Camera Position<br/>

<h2 id="toc_1">4.2 Zoom Lenses  and Prime   Lenses</h2>

<p><strong>THE BASICS</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ol>
<li> Zoom lenses allow you to change the focal length of a single lens</li>
<li> Prime lenses are a single focal length for a given lens</li>
<li> Zoom lenses are versatile, but often heavy and usually don’t have a large maximum aperture</li>
<li> Prime lenses are usually lighter and often have a large maximum aperture</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="media/15126472551837/15126479269431.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>One of the many choices that you have as a photographer is whether to choose a zoom lens or a fixed-focal-length or “prime” lens for your photography. It’s likely that your camera, whether a film or digital model, came with a zoom lens when you purchased it, yet you may find other photographers extolling the virtues of prime lenses. What are the diﬀerences between zooms and primes?</p>

<p><strong>Zoom Lenses</strong><br/>
A zoom lens has a variable focal length. When you turn the zoom ring on the lens, you move glass elements inside the lens to achieve a diﬀerent angle of view. So, you can start out looking at your subject with a wide angle of view and, by turning the zoom ring, change to a narrow angle of view, all with one lens. Because of the complex optical elements inside a zoom lens, they are often large and heavy, but they make up for their bulk by being versatile.</p>

<p>Zoom lenses have some specifications which can tell you about the characteristics of a given lens. For example, a lens might be referred to as “18mm to 55mm” (or just “18 to 55”), which means that the lens can be set for any focal length between 18mm and 55mm.</p>

<p>Additionally, many zoom lenses (especially inexpensive, consumer-grade zooms) might also have variable aperture ranges, so  you might see something like f/3.5-5.6. This means that the larger aperture is available at the wider-angle focal lengths but the lens switches to the slightly smaller aperture number as its largest aperture at the longer focal lengths.</p>

<p>Stepping up to a (more expensive!) professional-level zoom lens will give you a consistent (and usually larger) aperture value throughout the lens’ zoom range.</p>

<p><strong>Prime Lenses</strong><br/>
In contrast to a zoom lens, a prime lens is a lens with a fixed focal length, so its angle of view is always the same and cannot be changed. The only way you can make your subject appear larger or smaller is to move yourself closer to or farther from the subject.</p>

<p>Given that zoom lenses can cover many focal lengths in just one lens, the question might arise as to why anyone would want a fixed focal length lens. There are essentially four reasons that prime lenses are prized by photographers: speed, quality, cost, and size.<br/>
<img src="media/15126472551837/15126481747962.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
<em>A 28-135mm Zoom Lens (left) and a 50mm Prime lens (right). The zoom has a variable aperture of ƒ/3.5 for wide settings and ƒ/5.6 for the telephoto settings, while the prime lens has an ƒ/1.8 opening.</em><br/>
First on the list is speed. The maximum aperture opening on prime lenses is usually much bigger than on zoom lenses, especially relative to cost. So, it’s easier to find a prime lens with a maximum opening of ƒ/1.8 or even ƒ/1.4 than it is to find a zoom lens with that capability. This means the ability to photograph in lower light levels and to create very shallow depth of field. A lens with a large maximum aperture is said to be a “fast” lens.</p>

<p>A second benefit for prime lenses is their image quality. Despite the advances in modern zoom lenses, prime lenses often produce sharper, higher-quality images than their zoom counterparts.<br/>
Many photographers love the sharpness and contrast that prime lenses provide.</p>

<p>Thirdly, prime lenses are usually cost-effective. Many modern prime lenses are inexpensive, especially for their quality and zoom lenses, especially the best-quality ones, are usually quite costly. A set of three fast prime lenses that cover the range of focal lengths that a zoom might handle can be less expensive than a single high-quality zoom lens. So, regardless of your budget, you can experience world-class optics at a fraction of a cost of an expensive zoom.</p>

<p>Lastly, prime lenses are almost always much smaller and much lighter than zoom lenses. This means that you’re lugging around less weight with a camera body and a couple of prime lenses than a camera body and a single zoom.</p>

<p>Most photographers find that a mix of prime and zoom lenses is a good option for their needs. If you purchased a camera with an inexpensive “kit” zoom lens, you may want to consider upgrading to a faster zoom with a consistent aperture range at some future point. For prime lenses, a good choice might be a 50mm ƒ/1.8, a reasonably priced lens available from most manufacturers.</p>

<p><img src="media/15126472551837/15126482960051.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
<em>Choose your camera position first, then choose the focal length that frames the scene the way you want it.</em></p>

<p><strong>Zoom With Your Feet</strong><br/>
Whether you have a single zoom, a set of prime lenses or a combination of both, there is a strategy that can really help you use your lenses eﬀectively that I like to call “zoom with your feet.”</p>

<p>This involves choosing your camera position first, making choices about how near or far you would like to be, how one part of the subject lines up with the others, etc, “zooming with your feet” to get to the right spot for the composition you want.</p>

<p>Then, when camera position has been established, choose the appropriate focal length of lens to fill the frame with what information you want to show — a short or wide angle of view lens will show more of your subject, a long or narrow angle of view lens will show less.</p>

<p>This concept applies to zoom lenses, too; choose camera position first, then zoom to frame the area you want to see. Essentially, you can think of the range of your zoom lens as being a set of prime lenses; create your composition, then choose a focal length for how much or how little you want to show.</p>

<p>Using this strategy helps you avoid falling into the trap of standing in one place and just zooming randomly to find a good photograph. Remember that the position of the camera dictates subject interrelationships and the feeling of distance or proximity to your subject. The lens focal length will determine how much of the scene will appear on your film or digital sensor.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">4.3 Focus</h2>

<p><strong>THE BASICS</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ol>
<li> Focus defines what is sharp in your photographs</li>
<li> Most cameras have both autofocus and manual focus options</li>
<li> Autofocus works well most of the time, but manual focus gives you more control</li>
</ol>

<p>Focus is the degree of sharpness in your photograph; whether an image is clear or blurred. A lens is only capable of focusing on a single plane in a scene but you can use can use depth of field to bring more of the objects in front of or behind that plane into focus. Elements inside the lens move to correctly focus the light rays at the back of the camera.</p>

<p>In most modern cameras, there are sophisticated auto-focus systems that use a variety of strategies to figure out where to place the plane of focus. You can read about the various methods of autofocus that your camera employs in your owners’ manual.</p>

<p>In addition to autofocus, most cameras have the ability to allow you to focus the camera manually. Manual focus is a very, very useful tool to have, as it allows you to exactly define where the plane of focus falls in your photographs.<br/>
Make sure you know how to find the switch that switches between manual and autofocus on your camera and use manual focus when the camera doesn’t focus correctly for your needs.</p>

<p><img src="media/15126472551837/15126484592744.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p><em>In this photograph, the camera&#39;s autofocus system wasn&#39;t sure whether to focus on the fenceposts in the background or the foreground. A flip of a switch brought me into manual focus mode so I could get the objects I wanted to have sharp in my photograph into focus.</em></p>

<h2 id="toc_3">4.4 Depth    of  Field</h2>

<p><strong>THE BASICS</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ol>
<li> The aperture setting is the primary control for depth of field</li>
<li> The plane of focus is another element in controlling depth of field</li>
<li> Lens focal length is a third element that affects apparent depth of field</li>
</ol>

<p>Previously, you learned about at how the aperture setting on your lens controls depth of field (near-to-far focus) in your photographs. While the aperture is considered the primary method of controlling depth of field, there are two other elements at play, each of them working hand-in-hand with the other two to control what’s in focus in your pictures and what is blurred.</p>

<p>A second element that controls depth of field is the camera’s <strong>plane of focus</strong> or the place in your scene where the camera is focused, near-to-far. The closer the plane of focus is to the camera, the more shallow the depth of field will be.<br/>
Conversely, the farther away the plane of focus is from the camera, the more things will be in focus near-to-far.</p>

<p>So, when you are very close to the subject and you need more depth of field, backing up will help you get more things in focus, near-to-far. Or, if you would like to have shallow depth of field, (blurring the background in a portrait, for example) moving in closer can help make that happen.</p>

<p>The depth of field behind the focal plane is always greater than the depth of field in front of the focal plane. So, to obtain the greatest depth of field possible in a given scene, focus your camera about 1/3 of the way into the scene and use a smaller aperture (ƒ/11 or ƒ/16) to bring the foreground and background into focus.</p>

<p>A third element that at least appears to affect depth of field is the <strong>focal length</strong> of the lens. The simple way to remember this is that the longer the focal length, the more shallow the depth of field. Shorter focal lengths (like 20mm) will appear to have much greater depth of field than a longer lens (like 200mm).</p>

<p>In actuality, while the focal length of the lens appears to have a significant impact on depth of field, if the subject is about the same size in the frame, the depth of field will remain about the same regardless of the focal length of the lens. Of course, to keep the subject about the same size in the frame, you would have to move closer with a short (wide angle) lens or farther away with a long (or telephoto) lens.</p>

<p>Composition is the art of arranging the elements in the frame so they make sense to the viewer and the photograph can be understood.</p>

<p>A good composition in a photograph is the best way of describing that subject in that situation.</p>

<p>The basics of composition only take a few minutes to learn but they can take a lifetime to master.<br/>

The basic concepts of composition in visual images are as old as the ancient Greeks. They understood the ideas of harmony, balance, and symmetry. These next few pages show explore the guidelines of <strong>The Essential Elements of Photographic Composition</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Simplify – reduce the elements in the image</strong><br/>
•   Pare the subject down to its essentials.<br/>
•   Eliminate the extraneous.<br/>
•   Swipe through the images here to see simple compositions in action (tap for full-screen).</p>

<em>A day at the beach, using a low camera angle to eliminate everything but the sky, the sand and a happy bucket.</em></p>

<p><strong>Rule of Thirds – impose an imaginary grid on your image</strong></p>

<p>•   Line intersections suggest places of center of interest.<br/>
•   Horizontal lines suggest horizon placement.<br/>
•   Vertical lines suggest placement for vertical elements<br/>
•   Swipe over the image at right to see how the rule of thirds can act as a guide to where to place subjects in your photographs (tap for full-screen).</p>

<p>Rule of Thirds<br/>
<img src="media/15126505892325/15126525597735.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p><strong>Lines – create a path for the eye</strong><br/>
•   Can draw eye across the frame.<br/>
•   “S” curves can create a serene feeling.<br/>
•   Diagonals are more “active” elements.<br/>
•   Foreground to background lines lead the viewer deeper into the picture.<br/>
•   Swipe through the images at right to see how lines can guide the eye through photographs (tap for full-screen).</p>

<p>Lines<br/>

<em>A snow-covered branch creates a tracery of lines.</em></p>

<p><strong>Balance – the “weight” of image</strong><br/>
•   Symmetrical—equal weight on both sides creates a feeling of solidity.<br/>
•   Asymmetrical—one side more weighted than the other creates a bit more tension because it’s more visually challenging to look at.<br/>
<img src="media/15126505892325/15126527336486.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
<em>Symmetrical Balance</em><br/>

<em>Asymmetrical Balance</em></p>

<p><strong>Framing – The use of foreground objects or elements in your images can add emphasis and depth</strong><br/>
•   Look for elements in the scene that can frame your subject<br/>
•   You may need to change camera position or focal length to use framing elements<br/>
<img src="media/15126505892325/15126528004955.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
<img src="media/15126505892325/15126528084879.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
<strong>Mergers – when foreground and background “collide”</strong><br/>
•   Learn to look at the 3-D world as if it is 2-D because the camera does<br/>
•   Changing camera position usually solves a merger problem</p>

<p><img src="media/15126505892325/15126529464157.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
The signs behind the subject’s head are distracting, but moving a few steps to the left eliminates the merger and creates a more pleasing image.</p>

<p><strong>The last guideline: ignore the guidelines and break the rules</strong><br/>
Often the best images come from “breaking the rules” but learning the rules first helps you to understand when to break them.</p>
